# Week 18 challenge

![Vegeta with scouter](image.jpg)

You've been tasked to help Vegeta read data from his scouter. Unfortunately he can't read digits because of the shitty free font used by the developers. Please write a script that accepts a number as input and gives back the number as text.

Examples:
```
getSaiyanLevel(0); // zero
getSaiyanLevel(10); // ten
getSaiyanLevel(30); // thirty
getSaiyanLevel(5000); // five thousand
getSaiyanLevel(1234); // one thousand two hundred and thirty four
```

Since Vegeta doesn't comprehend levels beyond 9000 just let him know:

```
getSaiyanLevel(9001); // it's over 9000!
```
