# Week 20 challenge

Write a function `mergeArrays` which takes in 2 arrays as first 2 arguments and output sorting direction as 3rd.
Both input arrays will be sorted, so perhaps you can take advantage of that.
However, the length and and input array sorting direction is variable.

**Note:**
The input arrays should not be mutated!
The result should always be a new array.

Examples:
```
mergeArrays([1, 2, 3, 4], [8, 7, 6, 5], 'asc') // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7, 8]
mergeArrays([10, 6, 2, 1, -1, -5], [3, 4, 7, 9], 'desc') // returns [10, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, -1, -5]
```
