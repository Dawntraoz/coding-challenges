# Passionate People coding challenges
## Instructions

run `yarn test` to run the latest challenge tests.
Develop your solution in `2021/w<week number>/solution.js` file until all tests pass.
Since you will send the contents of this file as your solution, all your code should be in this 1 file.

**WARNING!!: Do not commit your solution!** as that will disclose your approach to others!
The solution should be submitted as text in the link provided for each solution.

## Libraries

These are the util libs available to be required and used in your solution, shall you need them.

- date-fns
- immer
- lodash
- moment
- ramda
- rxjs

Expansion of this util lib list is possible, but should be discussed and then will be added in future challenges.


## Ranking
Only correct solutions count. Failing at least 1 test case immediately disqualifies the solution.
So you should make sure the solution works with the provided tests before submitting it.
You can submit multiple versions of your solutions. At the end, only the fastest will be taken into account.

Ranking is based on performance. Fastest average execution time (accross multiple tries) wins. F1 style points are awarded for each week.
- 1st place: 25 points
- 2nd place: 18 points
- 3rd: 15
- 4th: 12
- 5th: 10
- 6th: 8
- 7th: 6
- 8th: 4
- 9th: 2
- 1th: 1

### Extra points

- +5 points for the shortest solution (codegolf). Judged by the number of bytes your solution file has.
- +5 points for the most elegant and readable code. Judged by a jury.
